        <p><i>All you wanted was a Slurpeeâ„¢, and somehow you have found yourself haunted by a relentless marinara pasta demon. With a mysterious checklist discovered in your back pocket, what else is there to do but wander museums of memories and perform some arcane ritual to rid yourself of the haunting specter?</i></p>
        <br></br>
        <p><i>Play as yourself, play as me, play as spaghetti, play as sauce. Find closure in the end. Or don't.</i></p>
        <br></br>
        <p>This was my first Twine piece, and my first entry into the interactive fiction competition. Development of the game took about 10 months. The story is largely autobiographical.
            For that reason, I won't say much more about it here and let the work speak for itself. Estimated playtime is 1-2 hours.
